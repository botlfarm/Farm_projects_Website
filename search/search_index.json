Design criterial \u00b6 Able to be moved with our tractor (Kubota L48) We aomplish this with a pallet for attachemtn on the tractor. Our forks are 4' long The fork length dictates the total depth of the shelter. We need to be able to reach past center form the end so we can lift the shelter Able to be moved into position without letting animals out of their current paddock This requirment dictated that the shelters be lifted fomr the top so they can be lifted over fence lines without opening gates Max lift height of our tractor is about 10 ft. The fences are max of of 4 feet so this ment the shelters must be less tan 6' to the lift points For ease of sontruction the sidewalls would use a 4 ft sheet of plywood without having to cut it down There must be ability for the goats to get to the top of the shelter Goats like climbing things so adding rails to both sides of the shelter helps meat this requirment for winter time we need to reduce the amount of wind through the shelters intially we closed the ends with pallets during the winter and took off the pallets during the summer In the most recent version there are half walls built in on both sides of the shelter","title":"Shelters"},{"location":"shelters/#shelters","text":"We use thess shelters for our pigs, sheep and goats.
